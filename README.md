# Simple POC using Dependency Injection using awilix


## Setup
The recommended way to setup your environment is using `nvm`.

### NVM
Install [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
After you install it, run the command bellow, we will use the version specified in `.nvmrc` file:
```
nvm use
```

If you don't have the version installed in your machine, nvm will warn you and provide the command you'll need to run.
